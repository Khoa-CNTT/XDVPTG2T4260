## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- **Genre:** 2D Pixel Art | Roguelike | Dungeon Crawler  
- **Perspective:** Top-down  
- **Core Loop:** Explore → Fight → Die → Rebirth → Escape  

You awaken at the deepest floor of a dungeon, stripped of memory, purpose, and identity. The only thing clear: **you must go up.** Each time you fall, you are reborn — but the dungeon has changed. And perhaps, so have you.

## 🧍 Playable Characters

| Character       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
Sergeant 	|A disciplined soldier with a burst-fire rifle. Trained, alert, and always ready for combat. Treats the dungeon like a battlefield.
Nomad     |A wanderer with no clear past, carrying only a makeshift handgun. No training, just grit and luck. Doesn’t belong here — but won’t give up.
Shade     |A silent figure in worn robes, armed with a longbow. Arrows strike without sound. No one knows who they are — or what they’ve seen.
