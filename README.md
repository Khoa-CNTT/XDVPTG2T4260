Redelve - A 2D Roguelike Game
Welcome to Redelve, a 2D roguelike game where every death leads to a new beginning. Dive into the depths of an ever-changing dungeon as you fight your way through increasingly difficult levels. Each time you die, the dungeon shifts and changes, offering new challenges to overcome. Can you find your way to escape?

Game Description
Redelve is a dungeon-crawling, roguelike game where players must navigate through a mysterious and dangerous dungeon in order to escape. Each time you die, you are reborn at the beginning of the dungeon, but the layout is never the same. With each new run, the dungeon grows more unpredictable, testing your skills, adaptability, and determination.

Key Features:
Procedural Dungeon Generation: Every run offers a unique dungeon layout, ensuring no two playthroughs are the same.

Challenging Combat: Face off against various enemies, each with its own attack patterns and weaknesses.

Permadeath: Each death sends you back to the start, but the dungeonâ€™s layout shifts, keeping the experience fresh and exciting.

Simple yet Engaging Mechanics: A straightforward, easy-to-learn gameplay loop, with focus on exploration, combat, and survival.

Story:
You wake up at the bottom of a mysterious dungeon with no memory of how you got there. With no clear goal other than survival, you must find a way to escape by ascending through the layers of the dungeon. Each time you die, you are reborn at the beginning, but the dungeon is never the same. As you progress, you discover signs of your past, as well as cryptic messages hinting at the true nature of this place. Can you escape the cycle, or will you be trapped forever?

Playable Characters:
The Stranger: A mysterious figure with no memory of who they are, wandering the dungeon in search of answers.

The Trapped One: Someone cursed to be stuck in a never-ending loop of death and rebirth, trying to find a way out.

How to Play:
